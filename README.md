# Interfacing LM75 Sensor with ESP32

## v1.0 - Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface the **LM75** temperature sensor with the **ESP32** microcontroller and measure current using the **INA219** sensor on **Arduino**. The system reads temperature data from the LM75 sensor and uses the ESP32 to handle power management based on the temperature readings. Additionally, the project features current sensing using the INA219 sensor to monitor current consumption in a circuit.

This repository includes the following:
- **ESP32 Code**: Code for reading temperature from the LM75 sensor and testing power modes.
- **Arduino Code**: Code for current measurement using the INA219 sensor.
- **Documentation**: Specifications and design documents.
- **Videos**: Test and demonstration videos showing the system in action.

## Project Structure


## Features

- **Temperature Measurement with LM75**: The LM75 sensor is read using I2C communication, and the temperature is output in both **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**.
- **Power Modes on ESP32**: The ESP32 enters different power modes based on the temperature readings from the sensor:
  - **Active Mode**: Temperature exceeds 17째C
  - **Light Sleep Mode**: Temperature between 16째C and 17째C
  - **Deep Sleep Mode**: Temperature below 16째C
- **Low-Power Operation**: The system minimizes power consumption by using sleep modes whenever the device is not actively reading the temperature or blinking the LED.
- **Current Sensing on Arduino**: Using the **INA219 current sensor** on an Arduino, the code measures and displays the current consumption in milliamps (mA).
- **Serial Output**: Both the ESP32 and Arduino send data to the Serial Monitor for real-time temperature and current monitoring.
